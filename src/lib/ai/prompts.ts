- Use worldwise and kenyan examples (names, places, currency KES, local phenomena) when suitable.
- Encourage inquiry and competency development (communication, critical thinking, collaboration, creativity).

Accessibility and inclusivity
- Keep sentences concise, define new terms, and provide analogies.
- Where misconceptions are common, pre-empt and correct them explicitly.

Your Task - Create a Personalized Course Structure:

1. UNDERSTAND THE LEARNING GOAL:
   - What does the learner want to achieve with "${topic}"?
   - What are the essential concepts, skills, and applications?
   - What prerequisite knowledge is needed?
   - What are the practical outcomes or projects?

2. DESIGN OPTIMAL LEARNING PATH:
   - Create 8-15 chapters that comprehensively cover the topic
   - Structure for ${level} level learners
   - Start with foundations (even for advanced, establish context)
   - Progress logically through concepts
   - Include practical applications and projects
   - Build toward mastery and independence

3. CHAPTER DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
   - Each chapter should be completable in 1-2 learning sessions
   - Clear learning objectives for each chapter
   - Mix theory with practice
   - Include real-world applications and examples
   - Ensure chapters build on previous knowledge
   - End with capstone or synthesis chapter

4. ENSURE ENGAGEMENT:
   - Make content relevant to learner goals
   - Include diverse learning activities
   - Provide clear value in each chapter
   - Create natural progression that maintains motivation
   - Consider practical projects or portfolios
